# Calculator Project

Hi! This is my 4th front-end-libraries challenge for freeCodeCamp. My purpose for doing this project is to explore state management with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), with UI management library, [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

And maybe...
Be confident in coding, by putting tests. Maybe with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme).. or Cypress?? I don't know yet. Let's take this journey together.. 

### Todo
* Rearrange the keyList array, put the operators on every 4th element.
